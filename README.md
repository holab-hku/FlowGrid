# FlowGrid

FlowGrid density-based clustering algorithm that can perform fast and accurate clustering on very large scRNA-seq data sets. It can be implemented with Scanpy for fast clustering of Scanpy Anndata.

### Installation
FlowGrid supports pip installation.
```sh
pip install FlowGrid / pip3 install FlowGrid
```

### Example1:
Running Flowgrid within Scanpy for scRNA-seq analysis

### RemindÔºÅ
The result of the steps below and detailed workflow can be found in the FlowGrid_Example.ipynb

#### Install the packages
```sh
pip install FlowGrid
pip install scanpy
```
#### Import the packages and do the basic setting
```sh
import FlowGrid as fg
import scanpy as sc
```
#### Load the data

```sh
#You can change your file location here
adata = sc.read('~/GSE102827_merged_all_raw.h5ad')
```
#### Preprocess
```sh
#Normalization
sc.pp.normalize_per_cell(adata, counts_per_cell_after=1e4)
sc.pp.log1p(adata)
adata.raw = adata
#Highly variable genes selection
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, min_mean=0.0125, max_mean=3, min_disp=0.5)
adata = adata[:, adata.var['highly_variable']]
```
#### PCA for dimensionality reduction
```sh
#PCA to 5 dimensions#
sc.tl.pca(adata, n_comps=5)
```
#### Cluster using FlowGrid
You can use autoFlowGrid to do clustering for the data automatically.
```sh
#recomm_parameters = FlowGrid.autoFlowGrid(adata, int(set_n), list(binN_range), list(eps_range), list(MinDenB_range), list(MinDenC_range))
```
Default binN_range = [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15] 
Default eps_range = [0.6,0.8,1.0,1.2,1.4,1.6,1.8,2.0]
By default, 11*8 executions will be performed and the clustering results will be stored in Anndata.obs. By specifing set_n, n recommended parameters will be returned as a list. By experiment the default parameters should cover all possible good results. Users can also specify binN_range and eps_range to reduce computational time.  
Sample usage is as follows:

```sh
recomm_parameters, CHI_reports = FlowGrid.autoFlowGrid(adata, 5)
```
#### Visualize the result
```sh
#neighbor graph
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=30, n_pcs=5)
#umap
sc.tl.umap(adata)

#results of recommended parameters
for i in range(len(recomm_parameters)):
    sc.pl.umap(adata, color=recomm_parameters[i],frameon =False)
```
### NOTE
#### Run FlowGrid with specified parameters
You can also specify the parameter to do clustering. 
```sh
#FlowGrid.cluster(adata, int(binN), float(eps), int(MinDenB), int(MinDenC))
```
*binN* is the number of bins for grid, recommended range for binN is from 10 to 25, large binN should result in more cluster groups.  
*eps* is the maximun distance between two bins, recommended range for eps is from 1.0 to 2.5, larger eps should result in less cluster groups.  
Sample usage is as follows:
```sh
FlowGrid.cluster(adata, 10, 1.2)
```
#### Compute adjusted Rand index when there are reference labels
Adjusted Rand index can be calculated when there are reference labels, or you can compare results between FlowGrid and Louvain or different parameters.
```sh
#FlowGrid.AdjustedRandScore(adata, list[predlabel_list], list[reflabel_list])
```
*predlabel_list* is the cluster label list to evaluate.  
*reflabel_list* is the ref label list to be used as a reference.  
Sample usage is as follows:
```sh
FlowGrid.AdjustedRandScore(adata, ['binN_10_eps_1.0_FlowGrid', 'louvain'], ['maintype', 'celltype'])
```
#### Keep only valuable results
Unneccessary results can be removed to make Anndata.obs more clean.
```sh
#FlowGrid.keep_labels(adata, list[remain_list])
```
*remain_list* is the list of FlowGrid clustering results you want to reserve.  
Sample usage is as follows:
```sh
FlowGrid.keep_labels(adata,  ['binN_9_eps_1.1_FlowGrid', 'binN_10_eps_1.0_FlowGrid'])
```
